## 📊 **CLEANUP IMPACT**

### **Before Cleanup:**
- Multiple backup files scattered throughout project
- Empty placeholder files taking up space
- Outdated page directory with 15+ backup files
- Temporary development files
- Redundant configuration files

### **After Cleanup:**
- ✅ **12 redundant items removed**
- ✅ **Cleaner project structure**
- ✅ **No duplicate or outdated files**
- ✅ **Reduced project size**
- ✅ **Improved maintainability**

---

## 📋 **FILES PRESERVED (Intentionally Kept)**

### **Environment Files:**
- ✅ `web/.env.local` - **KEPT** (contains valid Redis credentials)
- ✅ `deployment/environments/.env.template` - **KEPT** (template file)
- ✅ `.env.production.template` - **KEPT** (deployment template)

**Reason**: These files contain actual configuration values and are used by the deployment system.

### **Build and Dependency Files:**
- ✅ All `node_modules/` content - **KEPT** (needed for application)
- ✅ Package files and lock files - **KEPT** (dependency management)

**Reason**: Essential for application functionality.
