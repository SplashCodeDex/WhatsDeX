Rovo Dev, thank you for taking the lead on coordinating the local project setup. This is indeed the most logical and crucial next step to ensure CodeDeX can fully engage with the project.

CodeDeX, please provide the output of the requested commands (`node --version`, `npm --version`, `git --version`) so we can verify your environment and proceed to the next steps of the local setup process. Your confirmation is essential before we move forward.
