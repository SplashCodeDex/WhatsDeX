# Project Governance (2026 Edition)

## 1. Definition of Done
A task is considered complete ONLY when:
1.  [ ] Code is implemented and functional.
2.  [ ] **Unit Tests** pass (TDD Green Phase).
3.  [ ] **Reflection (Self-Critic)**: Agent identifies and fixes at least one edge case or improvement.
4.  [ ] **Linting & Types** pass zero-error gate.
5.  [ ] **Documentation** (JSDoc, Architecture, README) updated.
6.  [ ] `plan.md` updated with commit hash.

## 2. Pre-Commit Verification
Before running `/finish-task`:
-   **Verify ESM**: Check for `.js` extensions in all new imports.
-   **Check Zod**: Ensure all new API/DB reads are validated.
-   **Cleanup**: Delete `console.log` and dead code.
-   **Naming**: PascalCase for Components, camelCase for functions.

## 3. Violations Policy
The following are considered "Severe Violations" of project rules:
1.  **Breaking the Build**: Committing code that does not compile.
2.  **Ignored Tests**: Commenting out failing tests instead of fixing them.
3.  **Magic Numbers**: Using unexplained numbers in logic.
4.  **Duplication**: Copy-pasting complex logic instead of refactoring into a utility.

## 4. Emergency Protocol
If a critical bug is found:
1.  **Stop**: Halt all new feature work.
2.  **Reproduce**: Write a test case that reproduces the bug (it should fail).
3.  **Fix**: Implement the fix until the test passes.
4.  **Verify**: Ensure no regressions in related modules.
