# WhatsDeX

`whatsdex` is a comprehensive WhatsApp automation platform that includes both a powerful WhatsApp bot and a full-featured admin management system. The platform uses [@rexxhayanasi/elaina-bail](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@rexxhayanasi/elaina-bail) for WhatsApp integration and supports a modular architecture through a command system.

## üöÄ Admin System Deployment

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Admin system deployment requires ADVANCED technical expertise**

The WhatsDeX admin system is designed for **enterprise-level organizations** with dedicated DevOps, Security, and Compliance teams. It requires extensive system administration knowledge and enterprise-grade infrastructure.

### Deployment Requirements

- **Expert-level** PostgreSQL database clustering
- **Advanced** Docker/Kubernetes orchestration
- **Enterprise-grade** security hardening (SOC2, HIPAA, GDPR)
- **Production** multi-region cloud deployments
- **Expert** network security and compliance knowledge

#### Enterprise Infrastructure Requirements
- **8-core CPU** with AVX-512, **128GB ECC RAM**
- **NVMe SSD RAID-10** with 2TB+ storage

## How to Get Started

Follow these steps to set up and run `whatsdex`:

### 1. Cloning the Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SplashCodeDex/WhatsDeX.git
cd whatsdex
```

### 2. Dependency Installation

Install all required dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configuration

Rename the `config.example.js` file to `config.js`, then adjust the configuration such as the bot's name, default messages, bot owner's number, and more.

## Authentication Adapter

`whatsdex` supports storing authentication sessions using a choice of databases: **MySQL**, **MongoDB**, and **Firebase**. Choose and set up your preferred database with the following steps:

### 1. Select Database Adapter

In the `config.js` configuration file, adjust the `authAdapter` section with the database adapter you have chosen.

### 2. Install Database Module

After selecting the desired adapter, run the following command to install the required module:

```bash
npm run install:adapter
```

This command will install the module corresponding to the adapter configuration you have chosen.

### 3. Make sure the Database is Active

Make sure your database server is active and accessible before running the bot. Check the following:

- For **MySQL**, make sure the user credentials and database name are correct.
- For **MongoDB**, make sure the entered URL can connect to the MongoDB server.
- For **Firebase**, make sure the service account credentials downloaded from the Google Firebase Console have been entered correctly.

## Running the Bot

Once the configuration is complete, you can run the bot with the following two options:

### 1. Run Directly

To run the bot directly in the terminal, use the command:

```bash
npm start
```

The bot will run until you close the terminal or stop it manually.

### 2. Run with PM2

If you want to run the bot as a background service that remains active even if the terminal is closed, use PM2:

```bash
npm run start:pm2
```

## WhatsApp Authentication

There are two authentication methods that can be used to connect the bot to your WhatsApp account:

### 1. Using Pairing Code

- After the bot is run, a pairing code will be displayed in the terminal.
- Open the WhatsApp application on your phone, select the **Linked Devices** menu, then tap **Link a Device**.
- Enter the pairing code displayed in the terminal to link your WhatsApp account with the bot.

### 2. Using QR Code

- After the bot is run, a QR code will appear in the terminal.
- Open the WhatsApp application on your phone, select the **Linked Devices** menu, then tap **Link a Device**.
- Scan the QR code that appears in the terminal to link your WhatsApp account with the bot.

After the authentication process is successful, the bot is ready to receive and respond to messages according to the given commands.

## WhatsDeXBrain: The AI Core

The `whatsdex` bot is powered by `WhatsDeXBrain`, a sophisticated AI core that enables natural language understanding and conversational abilities. This brain is responsible for processing all incoming messages and determining the appropriate response.

### How it Works

1.  **Message Processing:** All incoming messages are first processed by the `WhatsDeXBrain`.
2.  **Intent Recognition:** The brain uses a powerful `nlpProcessor` service to analyze the message and recognize the user's intent. This service uses a combination of keyword matching, pattern matching, and the Gemini API for high accuracy.
3.  **Intent Routing:** Once the intent is recognized, the `intentRouter` routes the message to the appropriate handler.
4.  **Intent Handling:** Each intent has a dedicated handler that is responsible for generating the appropriate response. For example, the `greeting` intent is handled by the `greetingHandler`, which sends a friendly greeting to the user.

This modular architecture makes it easy to add new intents and capabilities to the bot. For more information on how to contribute to the `WhatsDeXBrain`, please see the [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
