use getcomponents() mcp tool, or magicuidesign mcp tool or shadcnui mcp tool for all required components you will need to fix or create to resolve the errors. If you can get the code using the mcp tools provides the code but struggle to implement it, just implement it with the code they provides. No placeholders, simulations or fake a dummy logics, use real data from the right project logic.I don't like the 'globe' and should be removed entirely from my project but any other components needed to be created to resolve the errors should follow these guidelines(consistent alignments, theme color, padding, magin and layout should be optimiised professionally to avoid off-screen view, overlapping neibouring elements, hiding UI and inconsistencies) from these mcp tools in my entire project. commands (npx add ....) should always be piped with echo 'n' because it might be interactive.
