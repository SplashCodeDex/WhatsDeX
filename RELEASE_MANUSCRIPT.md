# Release Manuscript

## Version 0.1.0

### Architectural Decisions

- **UI Framework**: Integrated `shadcn/ui` for a consistent and modern UI. This choice was made to leverage its pre-built components and theming capabilities, accelerating development and ensuring a high-quality user experience.
- **Styling**: Utilized Tailwind CSS for styling, enabling rapid and flexible design implementation.
- **Component Structure**: Established a clear component structure with a dedicated `components/ui` directory for `shadcn/ui` components.

### Feature Implementations

- **`shadcn/ui` Integration**: Successfully integrated `shadcn/ui` into the project, enabling the use of its rich component library.
- **Button Component**: Added the `Button` component from `shadcn/ui` as a foundational element for user interactions.

### Reasoning

The integration of `shadcn/ui` provides a robust foundation for building a feature-rich and visually appealing admin dashboard. By leveraging its pre-built components and theming capabilities, we can significantly reduce development time and ensure a consistent user experience across the application. The choice of Tailwind CSS for styling further enhances our ability to create a modern and responsive design.
