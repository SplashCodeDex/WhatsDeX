# Release Manuscript for WhatsDeX

This document serves as a living record of significant architectural decisions, feature implementations, and the reasoning behind them for the WhatsDeX project. Its purpose is to ensure any future developer or AI can seamlessly understand the project's evolution and continue its development.

## Initial Setup and Renaming (August 31, 2025)

### Decision:

The project, originally cloned from `itsreimau/gaxtawu`, was re-established as an independent repository under `SplashCodeDex/WhatsDeX`.

### Reasoning:

This decision was made to:
1.  **Establish independent ownership:** To allow CodeDeX to manage the project directly without being tied to the original upstream repository as a traditional fork.
2.  **Facilitate custom development:** Provide a clean base for future custom features, automation, and productization efforts as per CodeDeX's vision.
3.  **Maintain historical context:** Unlike a complete re-initialization, this method preserved the entire commit history from the original `gaxtawu` project, ensuring that all development lineage is retained.

### Implementation Details:

-   The existing remote origin (`git remote remove origin`) was removed.
-   A new empty repository (`https://github.com/SplashCodeDex/WhatsDeX.git`) was created by CodeDeX on GitHub.
-   The new repository URL was added as the new remote origin (`git remote add origin <new_url>`).
-   All local branches (`git push -u origin --all`) and tags (`git push origin --tags`) were pushed to the new remote, effectively transferring the entire history.

## Language Localization (August 31, 2025)

### Decision:

All user-facing text and comments in the codebase were translated from Indonesian to English.

### Reasoning:

This decision was made to:
1.  **Expand Accessibility:** Make the bot and its codebase accessible to a broader, global audience, aligning with CodeDeX's ambition for scalable productization.
2.  **Improve Maintainability:** English is a widely understood language in software development, which will facilitate easier collaboration and future maintenance by a larger pool of developers.
3.  **Standardization:** Align the project with common industry practices for open-source projects, which often use English for documentation and user interfaces.

### Implementation Details:

-   Identified all files containing Indonesian text, primarily in `README.md`, `config.example.js`, and various `.js` files within the `commands/game` and `commands/group` directories.
-   Used a combination of `replace` tool calls and manual file overwrites (for larger, more complex files) to perform the translations.
-   Ensured that code logic and variable names remained consistent, with only human-readable strings being altered.
-   Specific files translated include:
    -   `README.md`
    -   `config.example.js`
    -   `commands/group/add.js`
    -   `commands/group/approve.js`
    -   `commands/group/demote.js`
    -   `commands/group/group.js`
    -   `commands/group/intro.js`
    -   `commands/group/kick.js`
    -   `commands/group/listpendingmembers.js`
    -   `commands/group/mute.js`
    -   `commands/group/promote.js`
    -   `commands/group/reject.js`
    -   `commands/group/setoption.js`
    -   `commands/group/settext.js`
    -   `commands/group/simulate.js`
    -   `commands/group/unmute.js`
    -   `commands/group/unwarning.js`
    -   `commands/group/warning.js`
    -   All `.js` files within `commands/game` directory (e.g., `asahotak.js`, `caklontong.js`, `family100.js`, etc.)

### Future Considerations:

-   Implement a more robust localization (i18n) system if multi-language support becomes a primary requirement, rather than hardcoding strings.
-   Review all remaining files in the project for any untranslated strings or comments.
