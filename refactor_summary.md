This document summarizes the changes made during the refactoring of the WhatsDeX codebase.

## Changes

- **Replaced `@itsreimau/gktw` with `@whiskeysockets/baileys`:** The entire codebase has been refactored to use the official `@whiskeysockets/baileys` library instead of the old `@itsreimau/gktw` library. This change improves the stability and performance of the bot.
