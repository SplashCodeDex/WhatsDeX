# WhatsDeX To-Do List

This document is a God-Level intelligent roadmap for the WhatsDeX ecosystem, encompassing all projects by CodeDeX. It classifies tasks by status (Completed, In Progress, On Hold, Not Started), priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low), and project scope. Designed for seamless continuation by any alien or AI developer.

## Key Principles for This ToDo.md
1. **Intelligent Classification:** Each task is marked with status, estimated complexity (H/M/L), dependencies, and reasoning.
2. **Conflict Prevention:** Cross-references architectures and decisions in RELEASE_MANUSCRIPT.md.
3. **AI-Driven Synergies:** Leverages smart_analytics from memory.json for cross-project combinations.
4. **Mathematical Foundations:** Uses PERT equations for task estimation with LaTeX notation, e.g., Expected Time: $E(T) = \frac{O + 4M + P}{6}$
5. **Scalable Insight:** Integrates automation ideas, monetization models, and future enhancements.
6. **Dynamic Adaptation:** Tasks evolve based on new technologies, user feedback, or market shifts from risk_assessment.

## Intelligent Task Prioritization Engine
**Algorithm:** Priority = (Complexity Weight Ã— Urgency) + (Revenue Potential / Effort)
- Where Complexity Weight = {H: 3, M: 2, L: 1}
- Urgency based on dependencies and deadline proximity.
- Automated sorting shows highest-priority tasks first per section.
